<strong>THE ALISTAIR FINCH ESTATE</strong>
<em>Sale 77B — By Order of the Executors</em></p>
<p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
<p>It is with a mixture of profound reverence and somber duty that Aurelian &amp; Sons presents the complete workshop contents of the late Alistair Finch. A veritable titan of independent horology, Finch was a man who existed outside of time, even as he mastered its measurement. For fifty years, he remained a recluse in his cliffside atelier, communicating with the world only through the breathtaking, singular timepieces he produced.</p>
<p>His final years were, by all accounts, marked by a tragic decline into eccentricity. He ceased all work, severed his few remaining correspondences, and left behind a workshop filled not with new creations, but with his own priceless collection. It is this collection we present today. Found among his effects was this very catalogue, filled with his own annotations—a disquieting, fascinating glimpse into the mind of a genius at the edge of his own twilight. We present these notes as they were found, a testament to the complex man behind the perfect dials.</p>

<p><strong>LOT 001</strong>
<strong>A George Daniels ‘Space Traveller I’ Pocket Watch, c. 1982.</strong>
The legendary pinnacle of 20th-century watchmaking, one of only two ever made. Housed in 18-carat yellow gold, this masterpiece features Daniels&rsquo; independent double-wheel escapement, mean-solar and sidereal time displays, and an age and phase of the moon complication. The dial is a symphony of engine-turned silver. A piece of unmatched horological significance.
<em>Provenance: Acquired by Mr. Finch from a private collector in 1993.</em>
<strong>Estimate: £2,500,000 - £3,500,000</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the margin, a frantic, spidery scrawl:</em>
<em>It has his signature. The guilloché is flawless. But I held it to my ear last night, under the full moon it pretends to track, and the beat is wrong. It’s too perfect. Too sterile. Daniels’ work had a swagger, a faint, beautiful arrhythmia of human genius. This… this is the tick of a metronome in an empty room. They took the real one. This is their first, cruelest joke. It tells the time of the stars but has no soul of its own.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>LOT 002</strong>
<strong>The ‘Eleanor’ Automaton Table Clock, by Alistair Finch, c. 1978.</strong>
Considered by many to be Finch’s most personal and romantic work. The clock, crafted from lapis lazuli and silver, is surmounted by an automaton of a woman (modelled on his late wife, Eleanor) tending a garden of silver filigree roses. On the hour, she plucks a single rose and lifts it to her face, as a hidden carillon plays a hauntingly simple melody composed by Finch himself. The movement is a unique constant-force escapement of his own design.
<em>Provenance: The Artist’s personal collection.</em>
<strong>Estimate: Price upon request.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Beneath the description, the ink is bled and warped, as if by a tear:</em>
<em>Her face is perfect. The line of her neck, the way her silver fingers close around the stem. They even copied the chip in the lapis base where I dropped it, the day she first saw it and laughed. But it’s not her. My Eleanor, the real clock, moved with a hesitant grace. The music box would sometimes catch for a breath, a micro-second, before singing. It was alive with the memory of my hands. This automaton is a soulless dancer. It performs the ritual but feels nothing. It raises the rose to a face of polished stone. It mocks her memory with its cold, precise pantomime. WHERE IS SHE?</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>LOT 003</strong>
<strong>The ‘Orrery of Solomon,’ by Alistair Finch, c. 1995.</strong>
Finch’s undisputed magnum opus. A monumental floor-standing regulator of extreme complexity. The central dial displays an equation of time, perpetual calendar, and grand sonnerie, but its true marvel is the astronomical complication above: a fully functional mechanical orrery of the solar system, crafted from gold, platinum, and precious stones, accurate to one day in 14,000 years. The entire piece is driven by a gravity-fed remontoire system of unparalleled elegance. It is, simply put, one of the most important horological creations of any century.
<em>Provenance: The Artist’s personal collection.</em>
<strong>Estimate: In excess of £8,000,000</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The handwriting here is violent, carved into the page with a sharp nib. Several words are circled furiously.</em>
<em>THIS IS THEIR MASTERPIECE. The forgery that proves their power. I spent a decade on the original. My blood is in its brass. Its calculations were a conversation between me and God. I knew its every secret vibration, the ghost in its machine. THIS THING is silent. It is mathematically, cosmologically, materially PERFECT. And that is how I know it is a lie. Creation is flawed. Life is flawed. My Orrery breathed with the slight, beautiful errors of a living universe. This one is a diagram. A dead map of a heaven they have stolen and replaced. I took a hammer to the crystal dome last Tuesday. It would not break. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t. The Devil protects his own work.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>LOT 004</strong>
<strong>A ‘Journeyman’s’ Pine Mantel Clock, unsigned, c. 1965.</strong>
A simple, unadorned mantel clock. The pine case is roughly finished, and the hand-painted dial is slightly uneven. The movement is a basic but robust pendulum escapement. Believed to be the very first clock Alistair Finch ever completed, as a young apprentice. It keeps surprisingly accurate time.
<em>Provenance: The Artist’s personal collection.</em>
<strong>Estimate: £500 - £800</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The final annotation is small, almost illegible, tucked away at the bottom of the page. The script is exhausted, defeated.</em>
<em>Even this one. My first clumsy heartbeat. I remember the split in the wood near the VI. I remember the sound it made—a hollow, wooden knock, like a friend at the door. Now I listen, and there is only a tick. Sharp. Glassy. Impersonal. A stranger wearing the face of my youth. They did not just replace my treasures. They replaced my memories. They have taken everything, leaving behind these flawless, beautiful, ticking lies. I am alone in a museum of my own life.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="curators-note">Curator&rsquo;s Note</h2>
<p>The preceding narrative, &ldquo;The Duplicitous Escapement,&rdquo; is an exploration of Capgras Delusion, a rare and deeply unsettling neuropsychiatric disorder. Sufferers of this condition hold the irrational belief that a familiar person—or, in rarer cases, a pet, object, or even a place—has been replaced by an identical, soulless imposter.</p></blockquote>
<p>The delusion is believed to stem from a neurological disconnect. The brain&rsquo;s facial/object recognition system (the fusiform gyrus, which says, &ldquo;I recognize that face/object&rdquo;) functions correctly, but its connection to the limbic system, which provides the corresponding emotional response of warmth and familiarity, is severed. The result is a profoundly alienating paradox: the logical mind sees a perfect copy, but the emotional core feels nothing. The brain resolves this conflict by concluding, &ldquo;This looks exactly like my wife/my clock/my home, but it <em>feels</em> wrong. Therefore, it must be a perfect forgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our story, the reclusive horologist Alistair Finch projects this delusion onto the objects of his deepest emotional investment: his clocks. To him, they are not mere machines but living entities, imbued with the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of their maker and the &ldquo;breath&rdquo; of their own unique mechanical life.</p>
<p>The narrative structure—an annotated auction catalog—creates a powerful dialectic between objective reality and subjective experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>formal catalog descriptions</strong> represent the consensus world: sterile, factual, and appreciative of the clocks as priceless objects.</li>
<li>Finch&rsquo;s <strong>handwritten notes</strong> represent the fractured world of the Capgras sufferer: emotional, paranoid, and focused on an intangible, unprovable &ldquo;wrongness.&rdquo; The &ldquo;incorrect tick&rdquo; is the central metaphor for the missing emotional resonance; it&rsquo;s the subjective evidence of the imposter that no one else can hear.</li>
</ul>
<p>By channeling the delusion through a master of time and precision, the story highlights the tragic irony of a man whose life was dedicated to perfect mechanics, only to be undone by a flaw in his own internal, emotional mechanism. It is a mirror to the terror of a world stripped of familiarity, where love and memory are replaced by a cold, perfect, and utterly alienating echo.</p>
