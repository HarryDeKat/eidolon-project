LOG ENTRY: DR. ARIS THORNE. XYLOS ORBITAL. CYCLE 84.1

**Subject:** Vitis Memoriae, Specimen 734 (Designate: ‘Promise Vine’).
**Location:** Primary excavation site, Ruins of the ‘Promise’ First Landing Colony.
**Status:** Pre-fruiting dormancy. Monitoring preparations for the imminent Syzygy of Echoes.

**Observations:** Specimen 734 remains entwined throughout the skeletal ferrocrete of the old Governor's residence. Its primary taproot has bored deep into the foundation slate, a place no ground-penetrating scan has been able to resolve. For ninety years since its discovery, it has been quiescent, its broad, grey leaves displaying only a faint, chaotic bioluminescence—the background static of a history too deep to parse. It feeds on decay, on the slow release of energy from the crumbling colony, and in turn, it remembers. Or so the theory goes.

**Annotation:** *They called this alignment the Syzygy of Echoes. A poetic title from the original survey team. They believed the unique gravitational stresses and radiation bath from Xylos’s twin moons would stimulate the vine’s ‘historical consciousness.’ More likely, it’s just a specific set of environmental triggers for a reproductive cycle. Still. I sit here in the pressurized silence of the observation hab, watching the vine sleep, and I can’t shake the feeling that I am waiting for a ghost to wake up. My family name is on the memorial monolith orbiting this dead world. Thorne. A name etched in silence. Perhaps this vine can give it a voice.*

**Subject:** Vitis Memoriae, Specimen 734.
**Status:** Syzygy initiated. Active Chrono-Botanical Expression.

**Observations:** The change was not gradual. At 04:22 standard time, as the twin moons eclipsed Xylos’s sun, the entire network of Specimen 734 flared to life. The bioluminescence is no longer chaotic. It is a symphony. Coherent patterns of light chase each other down tendrils, pulsing from leaf to leaf. I can see… shapes. Fleeting, abstract, but structured. Bursts of solar-flare yellow chasing cool, fearful blues across the wall of the old refectory. In the nursery wing, the leaves pulse with a soft, steady rhythm of pink and white, a pattern I can only describe as… contented. The energy readings are off the charts. Crystalline nodes are forming at major junctions. The memory-fruits.

**Annotation:** *It’s like watching a city come to life from a great height. A city of light and memory. The science is breathtaking, but the artistry is what steals my breath. I recorded a pattern that repeated for seventeen minutes: a sharp, angular glyph of crimson light, followed by a slow, spreading wash of deep indigo. It felt like an argument. A declaration and a sorrowful rebuttal. I am no longer observing a plant. I am reading a manuscript written in lightning.*

**Subject:** Memory-fruit, Batch Alpha. First Ingestion Trial.
**Status:** Post-assimilation analysis.

**Observations:** The fruit was cool to the touch, a perfect, multi-faceted crystal of amber light that tasted of ozone and dust. The sensory flashback was… disorienting. There was no coherent visual data in the human sense. Instead, it was a purely botanical experience. I was rooted in the cool earth of the foundation. I felt the sun on my nascent leaves, the subtle vibration of heavy machinery compacting the soil nearby. I tasted the chemical signature of joy and hope in the sweat of the hands that laid the bricks above me—the faint, saline optimism of a new beginning. I heard the laughter of children not as sound waves, but as rhythmic, percussive tremors through my root system. The experience lasted 8.7 seconds but felt like a season of growth.

**Annotation:** *I am the wall. I am the floor. I am the silent witness that feels the echo of a footstep long after the person is gone. The history books speak of Governor Thorne’s inspiring speeches about the future. I just felt the solid, reassuring weight of his boot on the veranda above my roots as he practiced them, the vibrations full of a confidence he may not have truly felt.*

LOG ENTRY: DR. ARIS THORNE. XYLOS SITE. CYCLE 86.1

**Subject:** Memory-fruit, Batch Gamma. Sourced from the West Barracks ruins.
**Status:** Post-assimilation analysis. Growing concern.

**Observations:** This fruit was different. A shard of deep violet, it tasted of rust and fear. The flashback was jarring. Again, I was the vine, but this time I was clinging to the crumbling wall of the barracks. I didn’t see the argument, but I felt it. I felt the spike in cortisol and adrenaline from the colonists as their voices rose, the vibrations sharp and hateful in my tendrils. I absorbed the bitter tang of spilled liquor, the metallic scent of a weapon being cleaned with too much force, too much anger. The dominant sensation was claustrophobia—the feeling of being trapped not in a room, but in a growing, silent panic that had seeped into the very mortar of the walls.

**Annotation:** *The official record states the Promise colony fell to a sudden, virulent madness. A 'psychotic break' of unknown origin. But this was not sudden. The vine shows me the truth. This was a slow decay, a rot that started long before the end. The whispers of the ancestors are not epic poems; they are feverish, frightened secrets passed from stone to root. I feel a coldness that has nothing to do with the hab’s life support. I am cataloging the emotional blueprint of a ghost story.*

LOG ENTRY: DR. ARIS THORNE. XYLOS SITE. CYCLE 86.8

**Subject:** The Taproot Fruit.
**Status:** Contemplation.

**Observations:** It has grown where the vine’s heart meets the colony’s foundation, coiled around a corroded data slate. It is the only one of its kind. Not a crystal of light, but a sphere of perfect, light-absorbing darkness. It pulses with a slow, heavy beat, drawing every iota of energy from the surrounding network. All the other leaves have gone dim. All the echoes, all the memories, have been drawn into this one, final fruit. The syzygy is ending. The moons are separating. This is the last story the vine will tell for another century.

**Annotation:** *Every instinct I have as a scientist screams to collect it, to analyze its energy signature, to map its crystalline structure. But I am no longer just a scientist. I am a descendant. My ancestor’s name is on that monolith because of what happened here, because of the story held in this dark sphere. The other fruits were fragments, echoes of moments. This, I know, is the truth. The final, unbearable vibration. I am terrified to taste it. I am terrified not to.*

**Subject:** Understanding.

**Observations:** I consumed the fruit. It had no taste. It was a void.

The flashback was total. I was the vine. I was the entire network, spread across the whole of the Promise colony from the first day to the last. And I felt the truth.

It wasn't madness. It was the soil. A native microorganism, dormant, harmless, until it metabolized the specific alloy in the colonists' water filtration systems. It produced a neurotoxin. It didn't cause rage or violence. It caused a slow, gentle, terrifying unraveling. It severed the connection between emotion and memory. A husband would look at his wife and know he loved her, but be unable to feel it. A mother would hold her child and remember joy, but only experience a hollow echo. They were haunted by the ghosts of their own feelings. The arguments I’d felt before weren’t born of hate, but of a desperate, terrified attempt to feel *anything* at all. To provoke a response. To break the terrible silence growing inside them.

The final memory… the climax of the colony… was not a bang. It was a whimper. It was the slow, quiet cessation of all vibration. People simply… stopping. Sitting in their homes, their workshops, their gardens, and letting the silence take them. The vine recorded it all. Not as a tragedy, but as a slow, inexorable fading of the energy on which it fed. A deep and profound quiet.

**Annotation:** *My family name is not on a monument to a mystery. It's an epitaph for a sorrow too quiet to be recorded. They did not go mad. They were erased, feeling by feeling. This vine is not a chronicle of their lives. It is a memorial to their loss. My work here is not to translate. It is to bear witness. The syzygy is over. The leaves are grey and still once more. I am turning off the recorders. I am going to sit outside with the vine. We will keep the silence together.*

> ## Curator's Note
>
> This story explores the psychological concept of ancestral memory and the subjectivity of historical records through a unique, non-human lens. The narrative framework—a xenobotanist’s log—deconstructs history, transforming it from a series of documented events into a living archive of sensory and emotional imprints. The parasitic vine, *Vitis Memoriae*, serves as a powerful metaphor for how the past persists not as a clear narrative, but as a collection of fragmented, often painful 'echoes' embedded in the very environment we inhabit. The protagonist’s journey from detached scientist to empathetic descendant illustrates a profound truth: understanding our history requires more than analyzing facts. It demands a willingness to experience the emotional reality of those who came before. The story posits that the greatest tragedies are not always the loudest, and true communion with the past is found not in deciphering it, but in the quiet, solemn act of bearing witness to its sorrows.
