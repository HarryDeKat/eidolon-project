**TICKET ID:** 8A51-B477
**DATE:** 10.11.2077
**USER:** Alex Vance (alex.vance.designs@eidolon.net)
**SUBJECT:** Minor Latency & Command Dropping in CogniSys Eidolon v3.0

Hello Support,

I am a new user of the CogniSys Eidolon neural interface, serial number CS-E3-889-B1. I’m a freelance graphic designer and purchased the Eidolon to streamline my workflow, particularly the mind-to-canvas rendering features, which were advertised as seamless.

For the most part, the device is impressive. However, I’m experiencing some frustrating bugs. There's a noticeable latency between thought-command and execution, maybe only 200-300ms, but enough to disrupt a creative flow. More pressingly, the dictation-to-text feature is unreliable. It frequently drops nouns or adjectives from my sentences when I’m composing emails or briefs. For example, a sentence like “Please revise the blue logo on the lower-left quadrant” might be transcribed as “Please revise the logo on the quadrant.”

This is not the frictionless experience I was sold. Please advise on a potential patch or firmware update.

Regards,
Alex Vance

**SUBJECT:** RE: Your Ticket - URGENT - Data Corruption and Project Sabotage

This is an escalation of my previous ticket. The problem is far worse than "latency." Your device is actively corrupting my work. I just lost a major client, the OmniCorp account, because the Eidolon completely misrepresented the project brief stored in my own memory.

I accessed the memory of my initial client meeting, and the device rendered the client’s request for a “warm, autumnal palette” as a “stark, monochrome palette.” It presented this false information to me as a direct memory. I designed for three days based on this corrupted data. When I presented the mockups, the client was furious.

This is not a simple bug; this is a catastrophic failure of your device's core functionality. It is actively misrepresenting my own thoughts and memories. I am a professional, and your product has made me look like an amateur. I demand an explanation and a timeline for a fix. This has cost me significant income.

**SUBJECT:** CATASTROPHIC FAILURE - PERSONAL DATA BREACH & UNRECOGNIZED ENTITIES

TO WHOMEVER IS A HUMAN BEING AND NOT A USELESS AUTOMATON:

Forget the client work. Forget the money. Your machine is a menace. This morning, I used the Eidolon's daily planner function. It displayed my 9:00 AM reminder: “Coffee with Ele—” and that’s it. It truncated my wife’s name. Her name is Elena. It has been Elena for the fifteen years we’ve been married.

Then, when she walked into the kitchen, the Eidolon’s ambient facial recognition system tagged her as “UNIDENTIFIED ENTITY. SIMILARITY MATCH: 67% (USER CONTACT: ELIZA?).”

Eliza was my ex-girlfriend from two decades ago.

Let me be perfectly clear. Your product is not only broken, it is insulting. It is dredging up irrelevant data and failing to recognize the most important person in my life. This is a profound violation of my privacy and my sanity. What kind of shoddy algorithm are you running? Is my personal data being cross-referenced with some external database without my consent?

I am formally requesting a full refund and a return shipping label. I want this thing out of my house. It is a poison.

**SUBJECT:** DANGEROUS MALFUNCTION - Uncontrolled Motor Output - I REFUSE YOUR “DIAGNOSTIC”

Cancel your diagnostic. I am not the problem. I will not be seeing a “specialist” because your machine is garbage.

Today, I reached for my coffee mug, and the Eidolon’s haptic-assist sent a rogue motor signal down my left arm. It spasmed, knocking the mug off the table and shattering it. My entire left side feels… foreign. The device is making my own body feel like it doesn’t belong to me. It is clumsy, unresponsive. I tried to use my left hand to pick up the broken pieces, and it was like telling a stranger to do it. It just… wouldn’t.

This is no longer about bugs or data. Your product is physically dangerous. I am disabling all motor-assist functions, but I don’t trust it. I am documenting everything for the lawsuit that will inevitably follow.

Send. Me. A. Refund. Now.

**USER:** Alex Vance (alex.vance.designs@eidolon.net)
**SUBJECT:** REFUND. NOW. LIES. FIX IT.

CognoSys. You dont listen. The box is broke. I told you.

Elena says I am the broke. She cries. Says I fell. I did not fell. The machine made the floor slip. It made my leg go. The left one. It is not my leg. The machine controls it. It is proof.

She tried to take the Eidolon. To take my proof. I said no. I need it. To show them. To show you. You see? You see this writing? The machine is doing this. It mixes my words. I think “perfectly clear” and it writes… this. This mess. It is the ghost. The ghost in the machine. You put it there.

You have to fix it. Fix the ghost.

I am fine. It is the box. The refund. I need the refunb. My work is… the colors are all wrong. The left side of the screen is empty but I know I put things there. The machine steals them. Elena says there is nothing there. She lies like the machine. Everyone lies.

Send the box for the box. I will send it back. I am fine. I am. Just the box is…

not me. not me.

> ## Curator's Note
>
> The artifact you have just experienced, titled "The Ghost in the Machine is a Mirror," is a tragic exploration of Anosognosia. This profound neurological condition, often resulting from stroke or traumatic brain injury (particularly to the right parietal lobe), is not simply denial. It is a clinical inability for an individual to perceive or possess awareness of their own disability. The brain's mechanism for self-monitoring is, itself, damaged.
> 
> In this narrative, Alex Vance's series of increasingly desperate bug reports serves as an unintentional chronicle of his own cognitive collapse. The "faulty" neural interface, the Eidolon, becomes a scapegoat for his deteriorating mind.
> 
> -   His initial complaints of "latency" and "dropped words" are early signs of aphasia.
> -   The "data corruption" where the device misremembers a client brief is a manifestation of severe memory impairment (amnesia) and an inability to process information correctly.
> -   The failure to recognize his wife and the misidentification with an old partner are classic symptoms of prosopagnosia (face blindness) and confabulation.
> -   His report of "uncontrolled motor output" and the feeling that his left side is a "stranger" is a textbook description of hemispatial neglect and somatoparaphrenia—a deficit of awareness affecting one side of the body.
> 
> The Eidolon device, a tool meant for cognitive enhancement, ironically becomes the perfect mirror for his condition. He projects every deficit onto the machine, creating an external "ghost" to blame because his mind is incapable of seeing the ghost within. The story is a testament to the terrifying fragility of self-awareness, where the very instrument we use to perceive reality can crumble without our knowledge, leaving us furiously polishing a flawless mirror while we, the reflection, fade away.
