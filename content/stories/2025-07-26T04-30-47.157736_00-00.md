**POST-MORTEM AUDIT REPORT**

**CASE NUMBER:** 734-E
**SUBJECTS:** Subject A (Thorne, Julian) & Subject B (Vance, Elara)
**COMMENCEMENT OF SHARED ENTITY:** 14/02/2016
**DATE OF DISSOLUTION DECREE:** 19/08/2023
**AUDITOR:** K. Morgenstern, Division of Emotional Cartography
**DATE OF REPORT:** 01/09/2023

**I. PREAMBLE & METHODOLOGY**

This document represents the final reconciliation of assets and affect pertaining to the dissolution of the domestic and emotional partnership heretofore designated as the entity ‘Jules & Elara’ (hereafter ‘The Entity’). The purpose of this audit is to assign objective and subjective valuations to all co-owned material and immaterial assets, charting their perceived worth from the point of acquisition, through the period of peak relational stability, to the final, contested claims of dissolution.

Valuations are recorded as follows:
*   **VA (Valuation at Acquisition):** The initial monetary cost or equivalent exchange value.
*   **PJV (Peak Joint Valuation):** A qualitative assessment of the asset's maximum perceived value during The Entity’s period of optimal function. This value is often synergistic and exceeds the sum of its parts.
*   **FDV (Final Disputed Valuation):** The terminal value assigned to the asset by each subject during dissolution proceedings. Note: These values are often asymmetrical and reflect profound non-fungible emotional premiums.

**II. AUDIT LOG OF DISPUTED ASSETS**

**Item #001: The ‘Cerulean’ Coffee Mug**
*   **Description:** A ceramic mug, 12 oz. capacity, notable for a hairline fracture near the lip and a chip on the base sustained circa Q3 2019. Color: Faded cerulean blue.
*   **VA:** $4.50 (Acquired from a thrift store, Q1 2017).
*   **PJV:** *Symbol of the ‘First Morning.’ The quiet ritual of coffee before the city wakes. A vessel for unspoken assurances. Warmth.*
*   **FDV (Subject A):** $4.50. (“It’s just a mug. She can have it.”)
*   **FDV (Subject B):** $250.00. (“He bought it for me the day after I first stayed over. He said it matched my eyes. It’s not a mug; it’s a promise.”)
*   **Auditor’s Note:** Subject B’s valuation represents a 5,455% increase over VA, an attempt to quantify the asset's function as a foundational artifact of The Entity. The dispute is not over the object, but over the right to be the sole archivist of its memory.
*   **Resolution:** Awarded to Subject B. Subject A ceded his claim with the verbal addendum, “Fine. Keep your overpriced ghost.”

**Item #002: The ‘Norwegian Blue’ Sofa**
*   **Description:** A three-seater sofa, mid-century modern design, upholstered in a fabric described by the manufacturer as ‘Fjord Blue.’
*   **VA:** $1,899.00 (Acquired Q2 2018).
*   **PJV:** *The Sanctuary. Epicenter of domesticity. Site of movie marathons, feverish nights, whispered confessions, arguments muted by exhaustion. The topographical map of its cushions charts six years of shared gravity.*
*   **FDV (Subject A):** $3,000.00. (“I paid the deposit. It was my choice. It’s the centerpiece of the home *I* built.”)
*   **FDV (Subject B):** $3,000.00. (“I spent four weekends finding it. It’s the only piece of furniture that ever felt like *us*. I will not let him have it.”)
*   **Auditor’s Note:** Here, both subjects symmetrically inflate the asset’s value beyond its market depreciation. The sofa has ceased to be furniture and is now a proxy for the concept of ‘home.’ Each subject believes that to possess the sofa is to win custody of the past itself. The identical valuation is not a coincidence; it is the precise price of their mutual and irreconcilable sense of ownership.
*   **Resolution:** Asset to be sold at market value (~$700.00). Proceeds to be split. Both subjects formally protested this outcome as “a failure to comprehend the asset’s true significance.”

**Item #003: Vinyl Record Collection (Approx. 117 LPs)**
*   **Description:** A curated collection of vinyl records, spanning genres from 1970s folk to contemporary ambient. Stored in custom-built pine shelving (see Item #004).
*   **VA:** ~$2,400.00 (Aggregated over 7 years).
*   **PJV:** *The Shared Soundtrack. A meticulously constructed language of rhythm and melody. Each record a bookmark in time: the album for cooking, for driving, for the first snowfall, for making love.*
*   **FDV:** The collection became subject to a granular, line-item veto war.
    *   Subject A claimed exclusive ownership of all albums by ‘The National,’ citing “a profound, almost cellular, understanding of the lyrics that Subject B could not possibly appreciate.”
    *   Subject B counter-claimed all records by ‘Joni Mitchell,’ stating they were “part of a matrilineal emotional inheritance” and that Subject A’s listening was “performative.”
    *   The dispute over a single copy of ‘Rumours’ by Fleetwood Mac occupied four hours of mediation, with both subjects claiming the other secretly identified with the ‘wrong’ half of the band’s infamous breakup.
*   **Auditor’s Note:** The collection, once a symbol of unity, became an arsenal. Each record was a weapon, and its ownership a declaration of superior taste, deeper feeling, and a more authentic connection to the art they once shared. The value was no longer in the music, but in the power to deny the other access to it.
*   **Resolution:** Solomon Protocol enacted. The collection was divided record by record, alternating picks. The final album, a neutral ambient record by Brian Eno, was left unclaimed, an orphan of the war.

**Item #004: Fiddle-Leaf Fig, ‘Finneas’**
*   **Description:** A *Ficus lyrata* plant, formerly 6 ft. in height, housed in a terracotta pot.
*   **VA:** $85.00 (Acquired Q4 2020).
*   **PJV:** *A living testament to their joint ability to nurture. Its growth was a barometer of domestic harmony. Its broad, veined leaves were a source of irrational, shared pride.*
*   **FDV (Subjects A & B):** $0.00.
*   **Auditor’s Note:** The asset expired due to bilateral neglect during the final quarter of the dissolution. Found desiccated in its pot, leaves brittle and brown, in the corner of the vacated apartment. Its death was the one outcome for which neither party sought to claim ownership. It stands as the most accurate and objective artifact of The Entity’s final state.
*   **Resolution:** Asset disposed of by building superintendent.

**Item #005: Immaterial Asset - The ‘Sunday Lasagna’ Recipe**
*   **Description:** A non-codified, multi-generational recipe for lasagna, transmitted to Subject A by his grandmother. Subject B perfected its execution over the course of the relationship.
*   **VA:** N/A.
*   **PJV:** *The taste of unconditional care. The alchemy of flour, tomato, and cheese transformed into a fortress against the outside world. An edible act of love.*
*   **FDV (Subject A):** Claims ownership of the recipe’s “soul” and “heritage.” Demands Subject B cease and desist all future preparation. (“She can’t make my grandmother’s food for someone else. It’s a violation.”)
*   **FDV (Subject B):** Claims ownership of the recipe’s “mastery” and “execution.” States the original recipe was “flawed” and her modifications have rendered it a new, distinct creation. (“It’s my hands that made it a ritual. He just owns the ghost of a memory.”)
*   **Auditor’s Note:** The most contentious asset of the audit is one that cannot be held. It exists only in memory and muscle memory. The dispute is over the ownership of comfort, of tradition, of the very act of nourishment. To possess the recipe is to possess the power to replicate a core sensation of The Entity’s peak happiness.
*   **Resolution:** Unresolvable by this office. Recommendation: The memory of a taste cannot be divided, only soured for both parties.

**III. AUDITOR’S SUMMARY**

The total monetary value of the disputed assets at acquisition was approximately $4,442.50. The Final Disputed Valuation, when monetized claims are aggregated, exceeds $6,500, not including the incalculable values assigned to immaterials. This discrepancy of over $2,000 represents the raw, quantifiable price of the endowment. It is the sum paid not for the things themselves, but for the stories they were forced to carry.

The final balance sheet of a shared life is rarely written in black ink. It is tallied in the red of affective debt, an emotional liability neither party can afford to repay, but which both will continue to carry. The assets have been divided. The sense of loss, it appears, has doubled.

**[END OF REPORT]**

> ## Curator's Note
>
> The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias wherein we ascribe more value to things merely because we own them. An object we possess is perceived as more valuable than an identical one we do not. This irrational inflation of worth is not about the object’s utility, but about its integration into our sense of self. It is no longer just ‘a mug’; it is ‘my mug.’

This narrative explores the Endowment Effect through the cold, clinical lens of a post-mortem audit report. The format itself is a creative constraint, forcing the raw, chaotic emotions of a breakup into a sterile structure of line items, valuations, and auditor’s notes. This juxtaposition is where the story finds its power. The mundane objects—a chipped mug, a sofa, a collection of records—become battlegrounds. They are no longer just possessions; they are artifacts, imbued with the memories, rituals, and shared identity of the relationship.

As the relationship dissolves, the "our" transforms into a fiercely contested "my." The Final Disputed Valuations (FDV) are the clearest expression of the Endowment Effect at its most painful. The subjects are not just fighting over things; they are fighting over custody of their shared history. The inflated prices and impassioned claims reveal that what they truly fear losing is not the object, but the part of themselves that is embedded within it. The report, in its brutal calculus, quantifies not the value of the assets, but the devastating price of unravelling a self.
