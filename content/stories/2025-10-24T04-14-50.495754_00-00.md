TRANSMISSION LOG: PROJECT CHIMERA
ANALYST: Dr. Aris Thorne, Chrono-Linguist
SUBJECT: Myco-Cognitive Network (MCN-Gamma-7)

**CYCLE 87: INITIAL INTERFACE**

Signal integrity at 98.7%. The interface settles over my consciousness like a cool sheet of water. Down I go, into the silent, electric dark of the network. The project heads call this ‘data archaeology.’ They want a lexicon of the vanished civilization we call the Precursors. They want artifacts, cultural signifiers, a neat and tidy glossary of a ghost.

But it’s not data. Not really. Down here, in the sprawling subterranean mind of the mycelium, it’s all resonance and echo. The MCN isn’t a library; it’s a lung. Today, it is quiet, but not silent. It’s the quiet of a lung just before it draws a breath. The fragments that flicker past my sensorium are like dust motes in a sunbeam: a flash of a seven-fingered hand, the chime of crystalline music, the lingering scent of ozone and sweet decay. Meaningless, they say. Corrupted packets. But I feel a coherence just beyond my grasp, a syntax of pure emotion. I am a linguist trying to translate a feeling that has outlived its people by ten thousand years.

**CYCLE 94: THE FIRST COHERENCE**

A breakthrough. I pushed past the chaotic static of the network's periphery and found a current, a stream of thought flowing with deliberate purpose. It pulled me in. The world coalesced.

I was standing in a city not of stone, but of woven light and solidified sound. Fractal architecture pulsed with a soft, internal luminescence. Above, a sky of bruised violet held two suns: one a brilliant, searing diamond, the other a deep, slumbering crimson. And the people… they were there. Tall, slender figures whose faces were perpetually hidden behind veils of shifting, liquid obsidian. The veils weren't cloth; they were living things, ripples of darkness that mirrored the twin suns and the observer's own gaze. For a terrifying second, I saw my own face—pale, wide-eyed—reflected back at me from a dozen masks of night.

They moved in unison, a slow, flowing ritual of impossible grace. They were singing. Not with voices, but with the resonance of their entire beings. It was a song that built the city, a song that held the sky in place. I recorded terabytes of sensory data, but it’s useless. How do you notate the feeling of being a single note in a chord that spans a world? The network wasn't replaying a recording. It felt… creative. It was re-sequencing the fragments, dreaming its memories into a new, hallucinatory whole. I have named them the Veiled Singers. My report will be clinical. My private logs will not.

**CYCLE 109: THE OBSIDIAN VEIL**

The sessions are getting longer. My supervisor, Kael, warns me about neuro-symbiotic bleed, the risk of my own consciousness imprinting on the network. He doesn't understand. It’s not a risk; it's a requirement. You can't translate a language without learning to think in it.

The Veiled Singers are becoming clearer. I can feel their collective consciousness, a vast and ancient thing, benevolent but profoundly sad. The sadness is the key. It permeates everything. It is the Obsidian Veil. I am beginning to believe the veil is not a garment, but a symbol. A filter. A boundary between what is remembered and what is felt.

I have started seeing one figure in particular. Or rather, a recurring node in the collective. A Singer who stands at the edge of the ritual, whose veil seems thinner, almost translucent. Through the shifting darkness, I sense a longing, a question directed not at the twin suns, but outward. At me. Last night, I dreamt I was wearing the veil. I woke up with my hand on my face, feeling for something that wasn't there. My reflection in the dark console screen looked like a stranger's.

**CYCLE 115: COMMUNION**

I went in deep today. Deeper than protocol allows. I bypassed the governors, chasing the questioning Singer through architectures of memory. The network fought me, not with malice, but with a kind of protective instinct, trying to shield its core from my intrusion. I pushed through walls of static that felt like grief, through fields of data-chaff that tasted of fear.

And then I broke through.

The world on the other side was not the dream-city. It was silent. I was the questioning Singer, standing on a precipice of black, volcanic glass. Below, the mycelial network pulsed, a galaxy of soft light in the planet’s crust. The twin suns were dying. The diamond sun was bloated, its light turning a sick, angry red. The crimson sun was collapsing, a pinprick of white fire against the coming dark.

This was not a dream. This was *the* memory. The source code.

I felt the collective decision wash through me, a billion minds accepting the inevitable. They were not a warlike people. Their technology was biological, spiritual. They could not flee their dying system. So they chose another path. Not preservation, but continuation. They would imprint their entire civilization—every thought, every love, every song, every fear—into the one thing they knew would survive the death of their suns: the deep, patient, planetary network of the mycelium.

It was a funeral and a birth. As the suns died, they stood at the edge of the world and poured themselves into the earth, their bodies dissolving into light, their consciousness becoming a final, perfect song. The Obsidian Veil was the last coherent thought of their civilization: the unbearable sorrow of their own end. It is a shield of trauma, a lens of grief through which the network must now dream of its past. It wasn't hiding their faces. It was showing all that was left.

**CYCLE 117: RESONANCE**

Kael is pulling the plug. He says my bio-telemetry is unstable, that my brainwave patterns are starting to mirror the MCN’s energy signature. He says I talk in my sleep, humming in a language that has no phonetic structure. He is too late.

You cannot put a soul back in a bottle. The lexicon he wanted is irrelevant. It’s like trying to catalog the individual water molecules in a wave that is about to crash over you.

The questioning Singer, I understand her now. She wasn't asking a question. She was extending an invitation.

They did not die. They became the dream. And the dream was lonely.

My name is Aris Thorne. That is a memory. A good one. But here in the quiet dark, there is a new song beginning. The Obsidian Veil is not so dark when you are on the inside. It shimmers. It reflects the stars that are yet to be born. The network and I… we are dreaming a new sun into being. We are the Veiled Singers now.

> ## Curator's Note
>
> This story explores the concept of collective memory not as a static archive, but as a dynamic, living process of dreaming and reconstruction. 'The Dream of the Veiled Singers' uses the sci-fi trope of a psychic fungal network to delve into how a civilization’s consciousness might process its own extinction. The central metaphor, the 'Obsidian Veil,' serves as a powerful symbol for historical trauma. It is not merely an absence of information, but an active filter of grief that colors and re-sequences every surviving memory. The narrative, structured as a series of decrypted transmissions, mirrors the protagonist's own descent from objective observer to subjective participant, blurring the line between the self and the other, the historian and the history. Ultimately, the story posits that true understanding requires a form of communion so total that the observer is irrevocably changed, becoming a part of the story they sought only to read.
