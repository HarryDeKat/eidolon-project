**SECTION A: ITEM MANIFEST & PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION**
---
**A1. Official Designation or Common Name of Item:**
(Client response, transcribed verbatim)
I don’t know what you’d call it. I call it... The Echo of a Shared Hand. No, that’s not right. It’s more solid than an echo. It’s the weight of it. The *pressure*. Let’s just call it ‘The Proximity.’

**A2. Abstract Category (Select one):**
[ ] Memory (Empirical) [ ] Dream (Oneiric) [ ] Idea (Nascent) [ ] Belief (Dogmatic) [X] Sensation (Somatic/Conceptual) [ ] Other: _______________

**A3. Brief Description of Item's Nature & Manifestation:**
(Client response, transcribed verbatim)
It’s the feeling of her hand, almost in mine. It's not a memory, because it never happened. Not really. We never held hands. But the space between my right hand and my side... it’s not empty. It’s full of... *her*. It has a temperature, a specific, imagined texture. Warm, from rushing in out of the cold. The slight roughness of a callus on her index finger. The shape of her knuckles. It’s a complete, sensory ghost. It aches. Sometimes it clenches, as if in response to a joke I just thought of. I find myself adjusting my gait to accommodate it, to keep from brushing it against a wall. It is the most real thing I have never had.

**SECTION B: PROVENANCE & ACQUISITION**
---
**B1. Origin of Item:**
[ ] Inherited [ ] Discovered [ ] Created [X] Accrued [ ] Commissioned

**B2. Narrative of Acquisition:**
(Client response, transcribed verbatim. Note: Client was hesitant, requiring several prompts.)
There’s a person. Clara. We worked in the same building for six years. Not the same office, different floors. We’d share the same elevator in the morning. We’d stand near each other at the corner coffee shop, waiting. Her order was a black Americano; mine, the same. A small, shared ritual we never acknowledged.

The Proximity began to form then. In those silences. It wasn't a decision. It was... an accretion. Like a pearl forming around a piece of grit. The grit was the possibility. Every time she’d laugh at something her friend said, and she’d catch my eye for a fraction of a second... a new layer would form. Every time we’d be the last two to leave the building in the rain, walking under separate umbrellas just a few feet apart... another layer.

The 'hand' itself coalesced on a specific day. There was a fire drill. The whole building emptied into the autumn cold. We ended up standing next to each other on the pavement. She was shivering, rubbing her arms. I had this overwhelming, tectonic urge to offer her my coat, to take her hand. My own hand lifted, just an inch. The space between us crackled. It was a pocket universe of unspoken words. But I didn't. Her friend came over, and the moment dissolved. But the shape of that moment—the space where our hands *should* have been—it never went away. It imprinted itself on the air, and then on me. She moved away two years ago. I haven't seen her since. The Proximity, however, remains. It’s louder, now that there's no chance of it ever becoming real.

**Appraiser’s Note (K.):** *Client exhibits a classic case of Hypothetical Haunting. The object is not an echo of a past event, but the psychic eidolon of a non-event. It possesses a remarkable degree of sensory verisimilitude, suggesting a powerful imaginative faculty in the client, now pathologized. The Sensation has become parasitic; it feeds on absence.*

**SECTION C: CONDITION REPORT & FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT**
---
**C1. Current State of the Item:**
[ ] Fading [ ] Stable [X] Intensifying [ ] Erratic

**C2. Describe any degradation or mutation over time:**
(Client response, transcribed verbatim)
It’s getting heavier. Sharper. When I first... acquired it, it was a gentle warmth. A pleasant sort of ache, like after a long walk. A sweet melancholy. Now, it has nerve endings. If I see a couple holding hands on the street, it sends a jolt up my arm, a pain like a slammed door. A cold, sharp pang of... of *negation*. Sometimes, at night, I wake up because I think I’ve rolled over onto it. I have to physically move my arm to alleviate a pressure that isn't there. I try to make a fist with my real hand, and I can feel the ghost-hand resisting, its phantom fingers tangled with my own.

**C3. Describe any impact on Client’s daily function:**
(Client response, transcribed verbatim)
I can’t date. How can you hold a new hand when you’re already holding a ghost? It feels like an infidelity to a person I was never with. I drop things. My real hand is clumsy, distracted by its phantom twin. I’ll reach for a doorknob and my proprioception is... off, calibrated for a reality that doesn't exist. I am living a life for one-and-a-half people. It is exhausting.

**Appraiser’s Note (K.):** *The Sensation exhibits high-fidelity somatic transference. It is no longer a passive concept but an active, intrusive sensory hallucination. It has bridged the gap from Abstract to Somatic. This makes it both highly volatile and extremely valuable. The integrity is paradoxically perfect; it is a flawless artifact of something that never was. A scar on the air.*

**SECTION D: REASON FOR PAWNING**
---
**D1. State the primary motivation for relinquishing the Item:**
(Client response, transcribed verbatim)
I want my hand back. I want the space beside me to be empty again. Emptiness is… it’s potential. This isn't potential. This is a monument to a dead possibility. It’s a tombstone I carry around. I want to be able to pick up a coffee cup without feeling the ghost of a second cup beside it. I want silence in my nerves. I want to be alone in my own body again.

---
**SECTION E: VALUATION & OFFER**
---
**E1. Preliminary Valuation:**
The Item is a rare specimen. A "Potentiality Ghost" of this fidelity is seldom seen. Its value is not in its history, but in its lack thereof. It is a perfect, hermetically sealed vessel of human longing. It possesses immense aesthetic and metaphysical weight. However, its parasitic nature makes it a high-risk asset to hold.

**E2. Basis of Valuation:**
*   **Sensory Fidelity:** 9.8/10
*   **Conceptual Purity:** 10/10 (uncontaminated by actual events)
*   **Emotional Resonance:** 9.5/10 (Prime Ache, Regret, Longing)
*   **Volatility:** High

**E3. Offer of Collateral:**
This Depository does not deal in currency. We offer an exchange in kind. For the relinquishment of **The Eidolon of Proximity (File No. 8C-Δ-7714)**, we offer the Client the following:

*   **One (1) Cauterized Memory:** The neurological pathway sustaining the phantom sensation will be sealed. The client will retain the factual knowledge of 'Clara' but will be divested of the associated somatic architecture.
*   **A Quorum of Quietude (Three Months’ Duration):** An induced state of psychic neutrality. An absence of echoes. The space in the client’s perception will be returned to a state of pure, unwritten potential.
*   **A single, clean slate.**

**Client's Decision:** [X] ACCEPT [ ] DECLINE
**Client's Signature:** *Elias Vance* (Signature appears slightly unsteady, as if written by a hand unaccustomed to its own solitude.)

---
**FINAL DISPOSITION:**
Item **8C-Δ-7714** has been successfully extracted and transferred to a high-security Somatic Vault. It now rests in a suspension field, a perfect, luminous outline of two hands, almost touching, radiating a faint, palpable warmth. It is a masterpiece of absence, a testament to the fact that the most profound hauntings are not by what we have lost, but by what we never reached for.

> ## Curator's Note
>
> The piece you have just read, "The Eidolon of Proximity," is a narrative exploration of Phantom Limb Syndrome, transposed from a physiological context to a psychological one.

Phantom Limb Syndrome is a condition in which individuals who have undergone amputation continue to experience vivid sensations—including pain, pressure, itching, and temperature—in their missing limb. The brain's map of the body, its neural architecture, persists even after the physical limb is gone, creating a powerful and often distressing neurological ghost.

In this story, the "amputated limb" is not a physical part of the body, but a potential relationship—a future that was severed before it ever had the chance to exist. The client, Elias, is haunted not by a love he lost, but by a love that was never realized. The bureaucratic format of the pawn shop form serves as a clinical, detached framework that forces the raw, emotional, and deeply personal experience into a structured narrative. The client's testimony methodically maps the "symptoms" of his phantom relationship: its sensory details (the warmth, the texture), the chronic ache, the way it interferes with his motor functions and daily life.

The narrative suggests that the human psyche can create its own phantom limbs from the amputations of hope, possibility, and unspoken connection. These ghosts of "what might have been" can be just as real, and just as painful, as any physical loss, leaving us haunted by the tangible weight of an absolute absence.
