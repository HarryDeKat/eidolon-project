Thank you for agreeing to this. The agency assured me you are their most discreet and sensitive sitter. Discretion is paramount. The house will speak to you, if you listen. It has its own rhythms, its own quiet sorrows. Your task is not merely to occupy the space, but to become a part of its delicate machinery for a short while.

The plants are straightforward. The ferns in the atrium require misting each morning; they enjoy the cool vapor before the sun crests the eastern hill. The orchids in the solarium are not to be touched. They are self-sufficient. Water the herbs in the kitchen garden only if the soil is dry to a depth of one inch.

Mail accumulates in the brass box by the gate. Please bring it in daily and leave it on the hall table. Do not sort it.

Now, concerning the central reason for your stay. The Resident.

He keeps to the West Wing, primarily the study and the adjoining bedroom. He will not trouble you, and you are not to trouble him. Your interactions are to be governed by a strict and inviolable protocol. This is not a matter of preference; it is a matter of stability. The air in this house is a delicate ecosystem, and a single disruption can cause a storm that takes weeks to calm.

**Morning Protocol (7:00 AM, precisely):**
On the kitchen counter, you will find a small, cobalt-blue bottle of oil. It is a blend of sandalwood and vetiver. Before you approach the West Wing, you must apply a single drop to the inside of your left wrist. This is your passport. It is the scent of safety, of continuity.

Prepare the tray exactly as described:
1.  One soft-boiled egg (seven minutes), peeled and placed in the celadon-green bowl.
2.  Two slices of toasted sourdough, lightly buttered. No crusts.
3.  A small pot of Earl Grey tea, with milk and sugar on the side.
4.  A single gardenia blossom on the tray, next to the teacup.

Approach the study door. Do not knock. Instead, hum the first four bars of Debussy’s "Clair de Lune." The melody is the key. Hum it softly, clearly. Wait. You will hear the sound of the heavy bolt being drawn from the inside. This is your invitation.

Enter, place the tray on the low table beside the leather armchair, and retreat without a word. Do not make eye contact. Your gaze should remain on the floor, the table, the window—anywhere but on him. He may be by the window, watching the birds, or seated at his desk. His presence is a constant, like a piece of treasured, fragile furniture. You are to move around it with grace and care.

**On Auditory Signatures:**
The Resident is acutely sensitive to sound. Your footsteps should be soft; the house is carpeted for this reason. Do not play music or television in the main living areas. If you must take a call, do so in the kitchen with the door closed.

You are not to speak to him unless he speaks to you first. This is unlikely to happen. In the event that it does, your voice must be a monotone. Low, even, and calm. Answer his questions simply. They will likely be about the weather, or the birds at the feeder. He is fond of finches. He will not ask who you are. Do not offer this information. To him, you are simply a function of the house: the bringer of food, the keeper of quiet.

**Afternoon & Evening Rituals:**
At 1:00 PM, a tray with soup and bread. The soup schedule is on the refrigerator.
At 4:00 PM, you will find a fresh change of clothes outside his bedroom door (grey sweaters, dark trousers). Remove the previous day's laundry from the wicker basket.
At 7:00 PM, the final tray. A simple meal. See the schedule.

After you deliver the evening meal, you may light the fire in the main hearth. He enjoys the flicker of the flames, though he watches them from the doorway of the West Wing, a silhouette against the light of his own rooms. He will stand there for some time. Do not acknowledge him. He is not looking at you. He is looking at a pattern he understands.

His world is one of sensory anchors in a sea of perpetual strangeness. The scent of sandalwood is *Safe*. The tune of "Clair de Lune" is *Morning*. The weight of his favorite cashmere blanket is *Comfort*. These are his constellations. You are, for this week, the steady hand that turns this orrery.

**Emergency Protocol:**
It is possible, though rare, that the protocol may fail. He may become agitated. You will know it by the sound: a low, guttural moan of profound confusion. He may block the doorway or begin to pace the length of the hall. He is not aggressive; he is lost. The anchors have come loose, and he is adrift.

In this event, your own calm is the only lifeline.

1.  Do NOT look at him. Avert your gaze immediately. The human face is, to him, a source of deep and painful chaos. It is a garble of meaningless shapes, a terrifying mask that changes with every flicker of light. Seeing your face will only increase his panic.
2.  Back away slowly into the main living room.
3.  On the mantelpiece, there is a heavy, lacquered box inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Open it.
4.  Inside, you will find a collection of objects: a child’s silver rattle, a dried seabird’s feather, a small, leather-bound book of poetry, and several photographs.
5.  Find the photograph of the woman with the silver-blue eyes and the laugh lines etched around them like a starburst. Her hair is the color of dusk. She is standing on a beach, the wind catching her scarf.
6.  Hold the photograph out towards him. Do not approach. Let him see it from a distance.

He may not recognize the image, the specific arrangement of features. He has not truly recognized that face in a decade. But he will recognize the object. He will recognize the ritual. He knows that this specific rectangle of paper is the icon for *Love*. It is the symbol for *Home*. He will remember that he is safe, that he is known, even if he cannot place the face of the one who knows him. The agitation will subside. He will retreat to his rooms, and the storm will pass.

Thank you, again. Your care for the quiet complexities of this house is a service I cannot repay. You are tending to the heart of my world.

His name is Arthur. Please be kind. He is the only one of his kind left to me.

> ## Curator's Note
>
> Prosopagnosia, commonly known as "face blindness," is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize familiar faces, including, in severe cases, one's own. It is not a memory deficit in the conventional sense; a person with prosopagnosia knows *who* their loved ones are and can recall shared experiences. What they lack is the specific cognitive ability to process a face as a unique, identifiable whole. To them, a familiar face may appear as a jumble of features, a constantly shifting and unrecognizable landscape.

This narrative, "A Handbook for the Keeper of the Hearth," explores the profound existential and emotional consequences of this condition from an indirect perspective. By framing the story as a set of care instructions, we invert the typical narrative lens. The reader, alongside the housesitter, is initially led to believe the subject is a reclusive or perhaps feral creature—a pet, an exotic animal. The meticulous, ritualistic protocols seem to confirm this.

The power of the piece lies in its gradual reveal, which forces the reader to re-evaluate every detail. The "auditory signature" of a Debussy melody, the "olfactory passport" of sandalwood oil, the strict prohibition against eye contact—these are not the eccentricities of pet ownership but the desperate, loving architecture of a life built to accommodate a broken perceptual tool. The story shows, rather than tells, how a family adapts to prosopagnosia by creating a new language of identity, one based on a grammar of scent, sound, touch, and ritual.

The final "Emergency Protocol" brings the theme to its heartbreaking climax. The photograph of the wife is not a tool for recognition but an *icon* for the *concept* of love. Arthur cannot see his wife in the image, but he recognizes the object and its associated feeling. The narrative thus becomes a meditation on identity itself: if the face is the primary vessel of selfhood in society, what becomes of the self when that vessel is shattered? The answer, as offered by Arthur's wife, is that love reconstructs identity through other senses, building a sanctuary of familiarity in a world of strangers.
