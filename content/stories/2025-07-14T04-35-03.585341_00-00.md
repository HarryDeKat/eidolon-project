**SUBJECT:** EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING: PROJECT CHRONOS – ACCELERATED SENESCENCE INCIDENT REPORT
**DATE:** [REDACTED]
**LOCATION:** Aevum Tower, 66th Floor, Obsidian Conference Room
**ATTENDEES:**
*   Marcus Thorne, Chief Executive Officer
*   Dr. Aris Thorne, Chief Science Officer

**TIME START:** 09:00:00

**[09:00:12] MARCUS THORNE:** Let us come to order. The purpose of this emergency meeting is to address the… public relations friction concerning the ‘Accelerated Senescence’ phenomenon reported in a statistically significant subset of our clientele. Julian, your summary.

**[09:01:45] JULIAN CROFT:** To put it bluntly, Marcus, we are facing seventeen class-action lawsuits, with more forming by the hour. The claim is uniform: sustained use of our Chrono-Vials results in a rapid, seemingly logarithmic aging process. Users who purchased a 'Decade of Moments' package—our most popular—are reporting symptoms congruent with individuals thirty to forty years their senior. The press is calling it ‘The Aevum Blight.’

**[09:03:02] ELEONORA VANCE:** (Scoffs, hand fluttering to her throat) A branding issue. We sold perfection, timelessness. A 'blight' is the opposite of the dream. We need to reframe this. It’s not a bug, it's a… an exchange. The ultimate price for reliving pure joy. We can market that. Scarcity, consequence… it's all very luxury.

**[09:04:33] DR. ARIS THORNE:** (Voice flat, weary) It is not a branding issue, Eleonora. It is a fundamental law of temporal dynamics that I warned you all about. We are not creating moments, we are borrowing them. The energy required to anchor a consciousness in a past 'Resonance'—a state of perfect, static memory—has to come from somewhere. It comes from the user's own timeline. We are not selling moments. We are selling temporal debt. And the interest is compounding.

**[09:07:19] MARCUS THORNE:** Aris, spare us the doomsaying. We are pioneers. Every great leap requires risk. The question is containment. How do we stop it? A patch? A counter-agent?

**[09:07:58] DR. ARIS THORNE:** Stop it? Marcus, you can’t ‘patch’ entropy. You can’t negotiate with cause and effect. The system is working exactly as designed, just… faster than my most pessimistic models predicted.

**[09:11:24] ELEONORA VANCE:** I… I feel a draft. Is the climate control malfunctioning? My skin feels… tight.
*(Ms. Vance subtly examines her reflection in the polished black obsidian of the conference table. She pinches the skin on the back of her hand; it does not snap back immediately.)*

**[09:15:50] JULIAN CROFT:** The core legal threat is our marketing. We used words like ‘eternal,’ ‘timeless,’ ‘fountain of youth.’ If Aris is correct, we have sold the most elegantly packaged poison in human history. Our liability is total. Marcus, how many Vials have you personally resonated with?

**[09:16:31] MARCUS THORNE:** (Voice sharp, defensive) The standard executive allotment. The wedding day. The birth of my son. The moment we secured Series A funding. They keep me sharp. Focused.

**[09:18:04] DR. ARIS THORNE:** They keep you anchored to a past that no longer exists, while your future rushes in to fill the void. We are the architects of this technology. We were its first and most avid users. We are Patient Zero, all of us.

*(A heavy silence descends upon the room. For the first time, the attendees seem to truly look at one another. A fine web of new lines is visible at the corners of Marcus Thorne’s eyes. Julian Croft’s distinguished silver temples seem to have crept further down, his jowls heavier than they were at the start of the meeting.)*

**[09:28:47] ELEONORA VANCE:** (Whispering) My hair… at the root. It's…
*(She plucks a single strand from her scalp. It is gossamer-thin and stark white. She stares at it, transfixed, her breath catching in a dry, rattling sob.)*

**[09:32:15] MARCUS THORNE:** This is absurd. It’s the stress. The lighting in here is unforgiving.
*(He attempts a confident gesture, but his hand trembles, revealing a constellation of faint, liver-colored spots that were not there an hour ago. He quickly hides it under the table.)*

**[09:41:09] DR. ARIS THORNE:** The fear… my God, the fear is an accelerant. I see it now. The feedback loop. The more you fear time's passage, the more you retreat to the Vials. The more you retreat, the more time you owe. The more you age, the more you fear. It’s a singularity, happening inside our very cells.

*(Dr. Thorne’s speech is now slurred, his face pale and drawn. A visible tremor racks his body. He fumbles for his water glass, the sound of chattering teeth echoing softly in the microphone.)*

**[10:02:54] JULIAN CROFT:** (Wheezing) My chest… tightness. Can’t… breathe. Call… My wife…
*(Mr. Croft clutches his arm, his face turning a mottled, dusky grey. His breath comes in ragged, shallow gasps. The skin around his neck hangs in loose folds.)*

**[10:17:30] ELEONORA VANCE:** (Hysterical laughter, thin and piercing) Look! Look at me! I sold beauty! I was the face of forever! Now look!
*(She points a gnarled, arthritic finger at her reflection. The face staring back is a roadmap of deep-set wrinkles, her eyes clouded with the faint, milky blue of cataracts. Her once-perfect manicure adorns fingers knotted with swollen joints.)*

**[10:38:11] MARCUS THORNE:** Aris! Fix this! You brilliant, useless man, you made it! Unmake it! Rewind it!
*(Marcus Thorne has risen, but he is stooped, his spine curved. His voice is a hoarse, guttural rasp. His hair, once a proud, dark mane, is now a sparse, snowy-white mess clinging to a spotted scalp.)*

**[10:59:42] DR. ARIS THORNE:** (Voice barely a whisper, a dry rustle of leaves) Cannot… rewind… only… borrow. We… are the… final… payment.
*(Dr. Thorne slumps forward, his head hitting the table with a soft, hollow thud. His hand, papyrus-thin and translucent, twitches once, then is still.)*

**[11:21:06] ELEONORA VANCE:** Cold… so cold… I remember the sun… on the beach at Positano… my first Resonance Vial… I just wanted to feel it… one more time…
*(Her weeping subsides into a continuous, low moan.)*

**[11:45:18] MARCUS THORNE:** Order… must have… order… the minutes… what do the… minutes… say…
*(He squints at the holographic display, his eyes struggling to focus. He reaches for it, a low groan of pain escaping his lips as his joints protest.)*

**[12:00:00]**
*(Silence. Julian Croft is motionless, his head slumped onto his chest. Eleonora Vance is curled into a fetal position in her chair, silent. Marcus Thorne stands frozen, one hand outstretched towards the table, his body a frail, skeletal silhouette against the panoramic window overlooking a city that has not aged a second.)*

**[12:15:00]**
*(Silence.)*

**[13:00:00]**
*(The only sound is the gentle, indifferent hum of the building's ventilation system. On the obsidian table, four figures sit in perfect, dusty stillness, like forgotten statues in a sealed tomb. Timeless.)*

> ## Curator's Note
>
> Chronophobia is the pathological and often irrational fear of time and its passing. It is a profound anxiety rooted in the awareness of our own mortality and the unstoppable, linear nature of existence. Sufferers may become obsessed with the passage of seconds, minutes, and hours, experiencing panic at the thought of wasted time or the inevitability of aging and death.

This narrative, "The Final Minutes of Aevum," explores chronophobia not as a passive fear, but as an active, predatory force. The corporation 'Aevum' (Latin for an age, or eternity) is the ultimate monument to this fear, a company built on the fantasy of conquering time. Their product, the "Chrono-Vial," is a tangible representation of the chronophobe's deepest desire: to escape the present moment and retreat into the perceived safety of a perfect, unchanging past.

The story uses its very structure—the transcribed minutes of a meeting—to heighten this theme. The timestamps, at first orderly, begin to leap forward, creating a sense of accelerated, runaway time for the reader. The central, tragic irony is that the board members' attempt to control and commercialize time becomes the very mechanism of their destruction. Their fear of aging, the core of their condition, acts as a "feedback loop," literally fueling the temporal debt that consumes them. They do not merely age; they are consumed by the very concept they sought to escape, turning their opulent boardroom into a memento mori—a stark reminder that time, unlike a memory, can never truly be bottled.
